<p>So.. Long time no see humm?</p>

<p>Yea.. I’ve been trying to get my head around JavaScript frameworks, such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>.</p>

<p>Being <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> the main focus, since, from my understanding, it does way less magic in the background which is actually a good thing in the early stages of <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> and <abbr title="Model View * Programming Pattern">MV*</abbr> learning, I’m breezing through a Laravel course <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/laravel-basics">@treehouse</a> as I was a pre-requisite for the Backbone.js course <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/connected-to-the-backbone">@tutsplus</a>.</p>

<p>Going forward I plan on making these weekly updates a thing!</p>

<p>So the plan for this week is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish up the Laravel Basics course</li>
  <li>Finish up the Backbone course</li>
  <li>Start a more advanced Backbone course with RequireJS integration</li>
</ul>

<p>And by the end of all this watching, hopefully, I’ll be able to actually build something myself, some serious forehead to keyboard moments will occur I’m sure.</p>

<p>And that all for this week.</p>
