So.. Long time no see humm?

Yea.. I've been trying to get my head around JavaScript frameworks, such as [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), and to a lesser extent [Laravel](http://laravel.com/).

Being [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) the main focus, since, from my understanding, it does way less magic in the background which is actually a good thing in the early stages of <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> and <abbr title="Model View * Programming Pattern">MV*</abbr> learning, I'm breezing through a Laravel course [@treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/laravel-basics) as I was a pre-requisite for the Backbone.js course [@tutsplus](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/connected-to-the-backbone).

Going forward I plan on making these weekly updates a thing!

So the plan for this week is:

- Finish up the Laravel Basics course
- Finish up the Backbone course
- Start a more advanced Backbone course with RequireJS integration

And by the end of all this watching, hopefully, I'll be able to actually build something myself, some serious forehead to keyboard moments will occur I'm sure.

And that all for this week.
